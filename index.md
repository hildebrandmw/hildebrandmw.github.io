## About

* My name is Mark. I know very little about many things, and nothing about most.
* I'm currently at [UC Davis](https://arch.cs.ucdavis.edu) studying Computer Architecture.
* I program a lot and thus have a messy [GitHub](https://github.com/hildebrandmw).
* There apparently only exists one decent photo of myself.
* I like to climb things.
